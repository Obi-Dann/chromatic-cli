**Chromatic Issues**
If you're experiencing an issue with Chromatic itself, such as a build showing a component error that
you don't see when running Storybook locally, you should [contact Chromatic support](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/support/).
If you're seeing an issue with the Chromatic command-line interface (the CLI tool itself), then this
is the appropriate forum to file a ticket.

**Bug report**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include screenshots if you can, but be aware this is a public medium. If you need to share private information, please contact the Chromatic support team [here](mailto:support@chromatic.com).
